# The U.S. NOAA Storm Data Analysis by type of harmful events, and by events with greatest economic consequences

## Synopsis

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The goal of this report is to answer to the follwoing questions about severe weather events:

(i) Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the *EVTYPE* variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

(ii) Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

This analysis shows that the tornadoes are the most harmful events for population health in the United States, floods caused worst damages for properties, and hurricane caused big damages on crops.

## Data Processing

The data for this project are in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm. Data can be downloaded from the [Storm Data](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2). In addition, there is some documentation available at the [National Weather Service Storm Data Documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf) where there are provided details how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

**More details about Data Processing and Results can be found in the files uploaded in the repository.**
